# x-magic's Scoop Bucket

Contains some of my own app manifests

These manifests are different from the official ones in one of the following ways: 
- It's an unofficial build, often due to a newer version (e.g. [iperf3](bucket/iperf3.json))
- There are unwanted _Start Menu_ shortcuts added
- There are unwanted shims added (e.g. [busybox](bucket/busybox.json))
- Softwares that are not in the official buckets yet (but I will most likely to submit those to official buckets)

[Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) is a windows package manager similar to apt-get or homebrew.

You can add this bucket to scoop using
```
scoop bucket add x-magic https://github.com/x-magic/scoop-bucket.git
```

## Why are you doing this? 
Because it's [head-bangingly](https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop-extras/pull/5616) [frustrating](https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop-extras/pull/5637), [borderline](https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop-extras/pull/5638) [impossible](https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop-extras/pull/5765) to contribute to the official bucket.
